# Contributing

Want to hack on MARKET Protocol? Awesome!

MARKET Protocol is an Open Source project and we welcome contributions of all sorts. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and helping us improve our community.

Please, start reading about our:
* [Development process](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/MARKETProtocol/CONTRIBUTING.md/#development-process)
* [Community guidelines](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/MARKETProtocol/CONTRIBUTING.md/#community-guidelines)
* [Coding style](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/MARKETProtocol/CONTRIBUTING.md/#coding-style)
* [Project board and GitHub labels](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/community/blob/master/docs/project-management.md)


## Development Process

We follow the (GitFlow)[http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/] branching model for development. The latest merged code generally lives in the `develop` branch of each repository. Your development flow should look like:

Find an interesting issue and communicate! Please let the #engineering Discord channel know what you want to work on
Add a comment to the issue so we don't have multiple contributors unintentionally working on the same task.
Please include your intended solution and a time frame for completion in the issue.
Start with the `develop` branch and create a new feature branch
Follow the appropriate (coding style)[https://docs.marketprotocol.io/#coding-style] and write some awesome code
See (here)[https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html] for some notes on good commit messages
Open a pull request to the `develop` branch, not `master`

## Coding Style
We use a variety of programming languages in our repositories. When contributing, please follow existing coding conventions and refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository, if one exists.

[comment]: TODO: update style For JavaScript, we use (NPM's style)[https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style], which is automatically enforced via (prettier)[https://prettier.io/].

## Community Guidelines

We want to keep the MARKET Protocol community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

* Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!

* Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.

* Keep it legal: Basically, don't get anybody in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break laws.

* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

Full code of conduct is posted available (here)[https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/community/blob/master/guidelines/code-of-conduct.md].
